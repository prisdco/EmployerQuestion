# EmployerQuestion
This is a .Net 8 Backend API with polymorphism as the focus to this task. It will help understanding the importance of SOLID in software architecture.

We have two sections: The first contains API endpoints for creating dynamic questionaire and updating questions by employer. The second conatins API endpoints for front-end to fetch questions prepared by employer and candidate to submit the questionaire.

There is a little xUnitTest.
